README FOR CSP PROBLEM

Default settings:
    - running map CSP
    - no heuristics
    - MAC3 is implemented

Running Map coloring CSP -> to change, uncomment line 8 and 9 in CSPDriver.java, and comment out lines 10 and 11
    - this will simply call the Circuit Board CSP instead of the map coloring CSP


To use heuristics:
    - Assign DH = 1 in CSP.java line 24 to use degree heuristic
    - Assign MRV = 1 in CSP.java line 25 to use Min Remaining Value Heuristic
    - Only assign one of them to 1 -> default if both are 1 is MRV
    - DH -> working for everything except for circuit-board problem with MAC3 inferences running
        - not sure why this is happening, I didn't have enough time to find this bug

To turn off MAC3:
    - Comment out lines 171-173 in CSP.java

Notes to reader:
    - The code has a bunch of commented out print statements used for debugging. Please ignore.
    - The output for the problems include all of the attemped assignment values. This is useful to the reader in
      following the course of the problem, and is especially useful in seeing how the heuristics and inferences affect
      the problem
